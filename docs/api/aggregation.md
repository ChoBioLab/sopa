# Aggregation

!!! tips "Recommendation"
    We recommend using the `sopa.aggregate` function below, which is a wrapper for all types of aggregation. Internally, it uses `aggregate_channels`, `count_transcripts`, and/or `aggregate_bins`, which are also documented below if needed.

::: sopa.aggregate

::: sopa.aggregation.aggregate_channels

::: sopa.aggregation.count_transcripts

::: sopa.aggregation.aggregate_bins

::: sopa.overlay_segmentation
